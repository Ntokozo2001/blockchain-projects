Blockchain Projects ⛓️✨

This repository contains a collection of blockchain-based projects developed to explore decentralized technologies, smart contracts, and Web3 applications. The projects demonstrate both fundamental and advanced concepts in blockchain, showcasing practical implementations for real-world use cases.

🚀 Features

Smart Contracts: Built with Solidity to handle on-chain logic

Decentralized Applications (DApps): Frontend integrated with blockchain networks

Token Standards: Implementation of ERC-20 and ERC-721 (NFTs)

Wallet Integration: MetaMask or Web3 wallet support

Testing & Deployment: Using Truffle/Hardhat/Ganache for local blockchain simulation

Use Cases: Voting systems, supply chain tracking, NFT marketplace, and DeFi mini-projects

🛠️ Technologies Used

Languages: Solidity, JavaScript (Node.js), Python (optional for scripts)

Frameworks: Truffle, Hardhat, Ganache

Frontend: React.js / Next.js, HTML, CSS, Web3.js or Ethers.js

Blockchain: Ethereum (EVM-compatible), testnets (Goerli, Sepolia)

Tools: MetaMask, Remix IDE, Infura/Alchemy (RPC providers), Git/GitHub



⚙️ Installation & Setup
